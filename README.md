## Introduction

Canary Checker is a Kubernetes native multi-tenant synthetic monitoring system.  To learn more, please see the [official documentation](https://canary-checker.docs.flanksource.com).

## Features

* Built-in UI/Dashboard with multi-cluster aggregation
* CRD based configuration and status reporting
* Prometheus Integration
* Runnable as a CLI for once-off checks or as a standalone server outside kubernetes
* Many built-in check types

## Comparisons

| App                                                     | Comparison                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Prometheus                                              | canary-checker is not a replacement for prometheus, rather a companion. While prometheus provides persistent time series storage, canary-checker only has a small in-memory cache of recent checks.  Canary-checker also exposes metrics via `/metrics` that are scraped by prometheus. |
| Grafana                                                 | The built-in UI provides a mechanism to display check results across 1 or more instances without a dependency on grafana/prometheus running. The UI  will also display long-term graphs of check results by quering prometheus. |
| [Kuberhealthy](https://github.com/Comcast/kuberhealthy) | Very similar goals, but Kuberhealthy relies on external containers to implement checks and does not provide a UI or multi-cluster/instance aggregation. |
| [Cloudprober](https://cloudprober.org/)                 | Very similar goals, but Cloudprober is designed for very high scale, not multi-tenancy. Only has ICMP,DNS,HTTP,UDP built-in checks. |

## Quick Start

Before installing the Canary Checker, please ensure you have the [prerequisites installed](docs/prereqs.md) on your Kubernetes cluster.


```bash
# install the operator
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/flanksource/canary-checker/releases/download/v0.38.154/release.yaml
# deploy a sample canary
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flanksource/canary-checker/master/fixtures-crd/http_pass.yaml
# check the results of the canary
kubectl get canary
```

`sample output`

```
